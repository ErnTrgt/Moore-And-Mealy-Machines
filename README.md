You can access the Mealy and Moore Machines codes, which I coded with simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript, through this repository.

In Automata Theory, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined by both its current state and its current inputs. This is in contrast to the Moore machine, whose output values are determined solely by its current state. The Mealy machine is a deterministic finite state converter: at most one transition is possible for each state and input.

In Automata Theory, a Moore machine is a finite-state machine whose current output values are determined solely by its current state. This is in contrast to the Mealy machine, whose output values are determined by both its current state and its input values. In Moore machines, as in other finite state machines, the input usually affects the next state. So the input may indirectly affect subsequent outputs, but not the current or immediate output.

Thanks.
